 ### How to use the boiler plate
-----
+ Clone Repo to a desired folder

+ Install by running cli command `npm install` inside the folder

+ Use webpack to bundle the boiler plate by running cli `webapck -w`
	the `-w` flag make it easy for webpack to rebundle the app every time there
	is a change inn the app's files.
	Webpack may or not be configured in your local `ENV`.
	So, in case you are getting an error try running in the cli 
	`./node_modules/.bin/webpack -w` 

+ Use `server.js` file to set up the desired port for local host.
	By default is set to `port:3000`, however you can change it.

+ Start hacking and have fun!
